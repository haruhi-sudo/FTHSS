The beverage was introduced in 1972 by 32-year-old Alan B. Canfield, senior vice president of Elgin, Illinois-based A.J. Canfield Beverages, a company founded by his grandfather.

    "I_A": "Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll is a 1987 documentary film directed by Taylor Hackford that chronicles two 1986 concerts celebrating rock and roll musician Chuck Berry's 60th birthday. A soundtrack album was released in October 1987 on the MCA label. The name comes from a line in Berry's song \"School Days\". The two concerts were held on October 16, 1986, at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis; among the artists performing with Berry were Linda Ronstadt, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, Etta James, Johnnie Johnson, Steve Jordan, Bobby Keys, Julian Lennon, and Joey Spampinato\nfrom NRBQ. Along with concert footage, the film also features scenes from the rehearsals for the shows, interviews with Berry and members of his family, and \"talking-head\"-type appearances from a number of musicians, including Bo Diddley, The Everly Brothers, John Lennon (archival footage), Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Little Richard and Bruce Springsteen. As told in the interview section of the Bonus DVD, Berry shot his voice at a cold open air concert the day before the filming of the movie. All of his lead vocals are therefore overdubbed in a studio. Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll Hail! Hail! Rock\nHail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll (album) Hail! Hail!

The event was held to celebrate Berry's 60th birthday and it included several special guests. The album does not include the Berry song \"School Days,\" which includes the line the album's title is derived from (although the song does appear in\nthe film). The release of this album on MCA was something of a homecoming for Berry, who from 1954 to 1966 and again from 1970 to 1975 recorded for Chess Records which, by 1986, was now part of MCA. Hail! Hail!

By c. 1607, Nanepashemet controlled the lands from the Charles River of present-day Boston, north to the Piscataqua River in Portsmouth and west to the Concord River. His influence stretched north to the Pennacook tribe, which inhabited the White Mountains region of present-day New Hampshire. As a tribal area, the Pawtucket controlled several territories: Winnisemet (around present-day Chelsea, Massachusetts), Saugus or Swampscott (Lynn), Naumkeag (Salem) (see Naumkeag people), Agawam (Ipswich), Pentucket (Haverhill), from the\ncoast going up the Merrimack. Daniel Gookin includes Piscataqua (Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Eliot, Maine) and Accominta (York, Maine) in the Pawtucket alliance. Other sources name Mishawum (Charlestown, Massachusetts), Mistic (Medford, Massachusetts), Musketaquid (Concord, Massachusetts) and Pannukog (Concord, New Hampshire) as Pawtucket territory. Nanepashemet was respected by his people as a warrior and a leader. His name was translated as \"the Moone God\" by Puritan Roger Williams in his \"A Key Into the Language of America.\" (1643/reprint 1827).

It includes the Naumkeag, Agawam and \"Aberginian\" peoples listed in early colonial sources. Prior to English settlement, the Pawtucket were likely part of the Massachusett Confederacy, but as the Massachusett were weakened by disease, loss of land, attacks from enemy tribes and competition from English settlers, most of the tribes fell under the influence of the Pennacook, an Abenakian\nPenobscot River in Maine. The Narragansetts and smaller tribes under their sovereignty lived in Rhode Island, west of Narragansett Bay, including Block Island. The Wampanoag occupied southeastern Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The Pocumtucks lived in Western Massachusetts, and the Mohegan and Pequot tribes lived in the Connecticut region. The Connecticut River Valley linked numerous tribes culturally, linguistically, and politically.

    "I_A": "The Seasons (ballet) The Seasons (, \"Vremena goda\"; also ) is an allegorical ballet in one act, four scenes, by the choreographer Marius Petipa, with music by Alexander Glazunov, his Op. 67. The work was composed in 1899 and first performed by the Imperial Ballet in 1900 in St. Petersburg, Russia. The score for Marius Petipa's \"Les Saisons\" (\"The Seasons\") was originally intended to have been composed by the Italian composer and conductor Riccardo Drigo, who was Glazunov's colleague and close friend. Since 1886, Drigo held the posts of director of music and \"chef d\u2019orchestre\" to the Ballet of the\nharmonium, guitar and even mandolin). \"The Seasons\" was commenced shortly after the premiere of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto, and continued while he was completing his first ballet, \"Swan Lake\". In 1875, Nikolay Matveyevich Bernard, the editor of the St. Petersburg music magazine \"Nouvellist\", commissioned Tchaikovsky to write 12 short piano pieces, one for each month of the year. Bernard suggested a subtitle for each month's piece. Tchaikovsky accepted the commission and all of Bernard's subtitles, and in the December 1875 edition of the magazine, readers were promised a new Tchaikovsky piece each month throughout 1876. The January and February pieces\nThe Seasons (Cage) The Seasons is a ballet with music by John Cage and choreography by Merce Cunningham, first performed in 1947. It was Cage's first piece for orchestra and also the first to use what Cage later called the \"gamut\" technique, albeit in an early form. Cage composed the music in early 1947, in the midst of working on \"Sonatas and Interludes\". A piano version was first completed, and an orchestral arrangement followed. Cage dedicated \"The Seasons\" to Lincoln Kirstein. The ballet was premiered on May 17, 1947 by the Ballet Society (by which the work was commissioned) at\na new orchestra version. Morton Gould retained the piano part for many of the pieces and orchestrated the work throughout, recording it with himself at the piano in 1951 for American Columbia. In 1965, Kurt-Heinz Stolze orchestrated a number of the pieces as part of the music for John Cranko's ballet \"Onegin\". More recent orchestral versions have been produced by David Matthews (for symphony orchestra), Peter Breiner (for solo violin and symphony orchestra), and Georgii Cherkin (for solo piano and symphony orchestra). French composer Philippe Sarde arranged the Barcarolle as a main theme for the 1988 movie \"The Bear\". Slava\nCranko was not invited to direct, and Sir John Gielgud was brought in. Prosecuted for homosexual activity, Cranko left the UK for Stuttgart, and in 1961 was appointed director of the Stuttgart Ballet, where he assembled a group of talented performers such as Marcia Hayd\u00e9e, Egon Madsen, Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil and Suzanne Hanke. Among his following choreographies were \"Romeo and Juliet\" by William Shakespeare in 1962, set to music by Prokofiev, \"Onegin\" in 1965, an adaptation of the verse novel \"Eugene Onegin\" by Alexander Pushkin, set to music by Tchaikovsky (mainly \"The Seasons\"), orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze, \"The Taming",

The Maiwand Lion statue was erected in 1886 to commemorate the loss of 286 soldiers (though the exact number varies by account) from the 66th Royal Berkshire Regiment at the Battle of Maiwand in Afghanistan on the 27 July 1880. The sculptor of this 31-foot statue was George Blackall Simonds and was unveiled in December 1886. It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. A cross memorializing Henry I was put up, at about\nthe Crown Court building. In the same year, the Reading International Brigade Memorial was relocated from the Civic Centre to a location on the east side of the gardens, and rededicated. A grand re-opening event took place on May 14, 2005, to mark the completion of a one-year restoration project. The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded Reading Borough Council \u00a32.13 million to restore the historic features of the Forbury Gardens and improve safety and access for visitors. The scheme was developed in consultation with residents and interested local groups. Work in the gardens themselves has included the restoration of the Maiwand\nLondon on 4 November 1922. The church of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, about east of the memorial, was selected as the regimental chapel in 1946. The memorial became a Grade II listed structure in 1972, upgraded to Grade II* in July 2017. An identical statue is one of five bronze figures by Toft forming a sculpture group for Oldham War Memorial, unveiled in 1923.

The siting of the memorial proved controversial: the first proposed site in the Market Place, close to some public lavatories, was rejected, and a second site by St Mary's Church was considered to be too close to a public house, the Greaves Arms. Other sites in Alexandra Park or close to the library were considered, before the decision was made to erect the memorial near St Mary's Church, opposite the Old Town Hall. The war memorial comprises a bronze group sculpture of five life-size soldiers in full battle dress and carrying\nFirst World War in Roman numerals on the west and east. The names of the village's dead are inscribed on all four sections of the lower plinth, to which the names of the dead from the Second World War were added at a later date. The construction work was undertaken by Frank Johnson, a local builder and stonemason. It was unveiled by Mrs Dunn-Gardner on 7 August 1921.

    "I_A": "52nd Street (album) 52nd Street is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released in 1978. It was the first of four Joel albums to top the \"Billboard\" charts, and it earned him two Grammys. Three songs reached the Top 40 in the United States, contributing to the album's success: \"My Life\" (), \"Big Shot\" (), and \"Honesty\" (). It was similarly well received by critics, earning the 1979 Grammy for Album of the Year. This Grammy was presented to its producer, Phil Ramone. Upon Ramone's death, \"52nd Street\"'s Album of the Year Grammy was passed on to\nJoel. Additionally, the album is notable for being among the first albums commercially released on the compact disc format, reaching store shelves on October 1, 1982 in Japan (it was one of fifty CDs released that day, including three other Joel albums, but bore the first catalogue number in the sequence, 35DP-1, and so is frequently cited as the first to be released). In keeping with this history, it was also the first release when Sony returned to manufacturing vinyl records in 2018. The title is a reference to 52nd Street, one of New York City's jazz centers in the\nmiddle of the century. Joel's label was headquartered on 52nd Street (in the CBS Building) at the time of the album's release. The studio where recording took place was also on 52nd Street, one block away from the CBS Building. Allmusic praises Joel for expanding stylistically on 1977's \"The Stranger\", describing \"52nd Street\" as \"more sophisticated and somewhat jazzy.\" (Jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard guests on \"Zanzibar\".) In 2003, the album was ranked number 352 on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. All songs written and composed by Billy Joel. The song \"Rosalinda's Eyes\" was\ninspired by Joel's mother, Rosalind Nyman Joel. The song was used in the 1982 feature film \"Personal Best\".

All four albums were produced by Phil Ramone and all four were critically acclaimed. The late Ramone wrote that the \"Lords\" nickname developed during the recording of \"52nd Street\" in 1978. Because the album had a jazz mood--Manhattan's 52nd Street had been the center of New York City's jazz scene in the mid-Twentieth Century--it featured an \"all-star\" line-up of jazz soloists as guest artists. The guests and Joel's band clicked so well during the recording sessions that the group garnered the nickname",

As the magazine published the Solomon Kane tale before Kull, this can be considered the first published example of sword and sorcery. 1929 was the year Howard broke out into other pulp markets, rather than just \"Weird Tales\". The first story he sold to another magazine was \"The Apparition in the Prize Ring,\" a boxing-related ghost story published in the magazine \"Ghost Stories\". In July of the same year, \"Argosy\" finally published one of Howard's stories, \"Crowd-Horror\", which was also a boxing story. Neither developed into ongoing series, however. After several minor successes and false starts, he\nevoking Howard's creation to one degree or another. In spring 1933, Howard started to place work with Otis Adelbert Kline, a former pulp writer, as his agent. Kline encouraged him to try writing in other genres in order to expand into different markets. Kline's agency was successful in finding outlets for more of Howard's stories and even placed works that had been rejected when Howard was marketing himself alone. Howard continued to sell directly to \"Weird Tales\", however. Howard wrote one of the first \"Weird Western\" stories ever created, \"The Horror from the Mound,\" published in the May 1932 issue\nboxing. From the age of nine he dreamed of becoming a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard's writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death. Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard's stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was \"Weird Tales\", where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard\nwriting a luxury he could not afford, and after 1930 he wrote little verse, instead dedicating his time to short stories and higher-paying markets. Nevertheless, as a result of this apprenticeship, his stories increasingly took on the aura of \"prose-poems\" filled with hypnotic, dreamy imagery and a power lacking in most other pulp efforts of the time. Further story sales to \"Weird Tales\" were sporadic but encouraging, and soon Howard was a regular in the magazine. His first cover story was for \"Wolfshead\", a werewolf story published when he was only twenty. On reading \"Wolfshead\" in \"Weird Tales\" Howard became\nIsland, West Virginia.

    "I_A": "Kolozsv\u00e1r Ghetto The Kolozsv\u00e1r Ghetto was one of the lesser-known Jewish ghettos of the World War II era. The ghetto was located in the city of Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kingdom of Hungary (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania). Between the signing of the Treaty of Trianon in 1920 and the Second Vienna Award in 1940, Cluj was a part of Romania. In 1947, the Paris Peace Treaties gave Northern Transylvania (including Cluj) to Romania. On 3 May 1944, the ghettoization of Kolozsv\u00e1r Jews began. The ghettoization was completed within a week. This was less than two months after the Germans invaded Hungary, on 19 March,\nand placed Hungary under a puppet government, the Government of National Unity. The Jews were concentrated in the Iris brickyard in the northern part of the city. This area consisted mostly of shacks used for drying bricks and tiles. The ghetto had practically no facilities for the approximately eighteen thousand Jews who were assembled there from Cluj and the surrounding Cluj County. The concentration of the Jews was carried out by the local administrative and police authorities with the cooperation of Protective Squadron (Schutzstaffel) advisers, including SS-Captain (SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer) Dieter Wisliceny. The ghetto was under the command of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Urb\u00e1n, the\npolice chief of Cluj. The ghetto's internal administration was entrusted to a Jewish Council (Judenrat). The members of this council included Fischer (as head), Rabbi Akiba Glasner, Rabbi Mozes Weinberger, and Ern\u0151 M\u00e1rton. As in all the other ghettos in Hungary, the local brickyard also had a \"mint,\" a special building where the police tortured Jews into revealing where they had hidden their valuables. The Kolozsv\u00e1r Ghetto was liquidated in six transports to Auschwitz (now O\u015bwi\u0119cim, Poland), with the first deportation occurring on 25 May and the last on 9 June. Kolozsv\u00e1r Ghetto The Kolozsv\u00e1r Ghetto was one of the\nof Jewish refugees allowed into Palestine, causing Kasztner to attack \"Perfidious Albion\" in \"\u00daj Kelet\". On August 30, 1940, The Second Vienna Award returned Kolozsv\u00e1r to Hungary's control. The city's Jews were happy at first, reasoning that Hungary's Jews had not been subjected to the same random killings experienced by Jews in Romania. Hungarian Jews were patriots, seeing themselves as Hungarians first, Jews second, and Hungary as their homeland, not Eretz Israel. Their jubilation was short-lived. As Germany's influence over Hungarian policies increased, Jews found themselves subjected to antisemitic legislation and violence. In 1941, the Hungarian government closed all Jewish\nPozsony (a former capital of the country), Kassa, and Kolozsv\u00e1r were lost. Under these circumstances, no Hungarian government could survive without seeking justice for both the Magyars and Hungary. Reuniting the Magyars became a crucial point in public life and on the political agenda. Outrage led many to reject Europe and turn towards the East in search of new friends and allies in a bid to revise the unjust terms of the treaty and restore the integrity of Hungary.

In the early period of Spanish colonization, it was the capital of the Apalachee Province. The site, now known as Martin Archaeological Site, was rediscovered in 1988. In the late prehistoric/protohistoric era the site became the capital of the Apalachee after the abandonment of the former capital, the Lake Jackson Mounds Site, in approximately 1500.

This acculturated multi-tribe permitted others to live with them as subordinate Siouan \"Occaneechi\". From 800 to 900 CE, the latest Woodland hamlet farmers (i.e. Drew Tradition) were experiencing milder weather and the introduction of corn. Around 1250, just prior to the Woodland II period (1350\u20131607), the Monacan, or Algonquian called \"Mandoag\", were driven by enemies from the northwest into the Piedmont James River region of Virginia. There they found an\nto be spoken fluently. Most of these languages are endangered, although there are efforts to revive them. Normally the fewer the speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment, but there are many small Native American language communities in the Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico) which continue to thrive despite their small size. In 1929, speaking of indigenous Native American languages, linguist Edward Sapir observed: According to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo.

This dialect is spoken by approximately 90 people on the Havasupai Indian Reservation at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. According to a 2005 New York Times article, it was considered the only Native American language in the United States spoken by\na code using the Navajo language. Today, governments, universities, and indigenous peoples are continuing to work for the preservation and revitalization of indigenous American languages. In \"American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America\" (1997), Lyle Campbell lists several hypotheses for the historical origins of Amerindian languages. Roger Blench (2008) has advocated the theory of multiple migrations along the Pacific coast of peoples from northeastern Asia, who already spoke diverse languages.

Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s was born in Villamuriel de Cerrato, Palencia, and entered the Society of Jesus, more commonly known as the Jesuits, in the novitiate of Aranjuez in 1953. He studied at the University of Alcal\u00e1, there earning his licentiate in philosophy, until 1960, whence he traveled to Japan to familiarize himself with Japanese language and culture. He began his theological studies for the priesthood at Sophia University in Tokyo in\non their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop. The crown expelled the Jesuits from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the Bourbon Reforms.\nelected at the first ballot and became the second Superior-General of the Society of Jesus. In 1560 Diego Laynez, now the Jesuit General, was instrumental in arguing that the Council should continue to its close, against Ferdinand I who wished to see a new Council opened and the prior decrees of the Council of Trent forgotten. Pius IV subsequently ordered the Council to meet again in the carefully worded \"Ad ecclesiae regimen\" of November 29, 1560; the Council was eventually opened on January 18, 1562. Upon Laynez\u2019s arrival at Trent in August 1562, he defended the practice of distributing Communion\nin his own diocese and he would be separated from his own flock by \"an alien authority\". The Jesuits found an ally against Palafox in the new viceroy, Garc\u00eda Sarmiento de Sotomayor, 2nd Count of Salvatierra. Salvatierra sought to arrest Palafox. In 1647, rather than be arrested, which might have produced an uprising in Puebla against the viceroy's abuse of authority, Palafox fled to the mountains outside the city. The move was calculated to show the crown that the situation in New Spain was grave, that the viceroy and the Jesuits were challenging the rightful place of episcopal authority. In",

Parapsychologist Konstant\u012bns Raudive, who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.

However, scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a\nof EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of \"instrumental transcommunication researcher\" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP.

He concluded: \"While we did\nIn the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice. The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings to be in a language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this, and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as \"Rorschach Audio\" has been described as a global explanation for all manifestations of EVP. Skeptics such as David Federlein, Chris French, Terence Hines and Michael\nreplicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings.

In 1644, 6,900 slaves on the African coast were purchased to clear the forests, lay roads, build houses and public buildings, and grow food.

He attained great wealth after having been an indentured servant and has been referred\nbrought as slaves to the United States. Angolan slaves may have been the first Africans to arrive in the Thirteen Colonies, according to Sheila Walker, an American film maker and researcher in cultural anthropology. This refers to an event in 1617 in Jamestown, Virginia, when Angolans were diverted by a Spanish ship to an English ship bound for Mexico. These first Angolan slaves of Virginia (15 men and 17 women) were Mbundu and Bakongo, who spoke Kimbundu and Kikongo languages respectively. Many of these early slaves were literate. Later, slaves were stolen by English and Dutch pirates from the Portuguese\nthe inhumanity toward the black slaves and the fact the country had more blacks than whites. Later, some 300 former Angolan slaves founded their own community in the Braden River delta, near what is now downtown Bradenton, Florida.

Initially, the two didn't get along; Kaufman has stated that the only reason the two hung out with each other was that Herz owned a pinball machine and Kaufman was the only person in their dormitory who owned a\noffice ($4.6 million gross worldwide). Aronofsky raised money for the project by selling $100 shares in the film to family and friends, and was able to pay them all back with a $50 profit per-share when the film was sold to Artisan. Troma Entertainment is a film production and distribution company founded by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz in 1974. The company produces low-budget independent films, many of which have developed cult followings. Kaufman has been outspoken about their use of guerrilla marketing and tolerance of piracy, and he has written the books \"All I Need to Know about Filmmaking\nOliver Stone), and wrote and directed another film, the Israeli comedy flop \"Big Gus, What's the Fuss?\". Kaufman also served as executive in charge of locations for \"Saturday Night Fever\", and was influential in choosing 2001 Odyssey as the nightclub in the film. From 1973-1979, Kaufman produced and directed a handful of adult films in New York under the pseudonym \"Louis Su\". He directed at least three movies: \"The Divine Obsession\", \"The Newcomers\" and \"Sweet & Sour\", and has been credited for producing at least three more.

Clarembald was a native of Normandy before he became prior of the Cluniac house Montacute Priory in 1155. Around 1158 he became prior of Thetford Priory, which he held until 1163. Clarembald was appointed to St Augustine's in 1163, at the command of King Henry II of England.

On 29 December 1170, Clarembald was host to the four knights, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, William de Tracy, and Richard le Breton, who were on their way to confront Becket. The knights asked Clarembald's advice, and the abbot-elect sent a knight of the abbey, Simon de Criol, along with the other four to confront the archbishop, which led to the murder of the archbishop later that day.

This earlier church, with all its endowments, was given in 1090 by Gilbert Fitz Richard de Clare to the Benedictine Bec Abbey in Normandy, of which it became a cell. In 1124 his son Richard de Clare, 3rd Lord of Clare (sometimes called Earl of Hereford), moved the monastic community from Clare Castle to Stoke-by-Clare, in Suffolk, located in\nroyal deputation to the papacy, along with Reginald fitzJocelin, Simon de Prisun, and Henry of Northampton. The envoys were part of diplomatic efforts on behalf of the king as part of the Becket controversy between the king and Becket. In 1168 the monks of St Augustine's complained to the papacy that Clarembald was allowing infants and small children to become monks of their abbey. The monks were given a papal ruling that stated no one should be allowed to become a monk younger than age 15.

Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families. In 1554, Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his \"Novelle\" which included his version of \"Giuletta e Romeo\". Bandello emphasises Romeo's initial depression and the feud between the families, and introduces the Nurse and Benvolio.

During his later years, when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism, Campbell is reported to have grumbled, \"I should have said, 'Follow your \"blisters\".'\" Campbell's scholarship and understanding of Sanskrit has been questioned. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto, said that he once met Campbell, and that the two\nbring me both my consciousness and my being.\" I think it worked. He saw this not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life: If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living.

He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris. Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann. The works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell's thinking; he quoted their writing frequently. The \"follow your bliss\" philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of \"The Power of Myth\" (see below) derives from the Hindu Upanishads; however, Campbell was possibly also influenced by the 1922\nrepeated phrase: \"Follow your bliss.\" He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his \"Star Wars\" saga. Joseph Campbell was born in White Plains, New York, on March 26, 1904, the son of Josephine (n\u00e9e Lynch) and Charles William Campbell. He was from an upper-middle-class Irish Catholic family. During his childhood, he moved with his family to nearby New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle, killing his grandmother.

The novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell's work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth.

Dan Brown mentioned in a \"New York Times\" interview that Joseph Campbell's works, particularly \"The Power of Myth\" and \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\", inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon.

He directed more than 35 feature films in a five-decade career after leaving the theatre. He first gained attention for film noir mysteries such as \"Laura\" (1944) and \"Fallen Angel\" (1945), while in the 1950s and 1960s, he directed a number of high-profile adaptations of popular novels and stage works. Several of these later films pushed the boundaries of censorship by dealing with topics which were then taboo in Hollywood, such as drug addiction (\"The Man\nCaesar\". As he read, watched, and after a fashion began to produce plays, he began to miss more and more classes in school. When the war came to an end, Markus formed his own law practice. He instilled in both his sons a sense of fair play as well as respect for those with opposing viewpoints. As his father's practice continued to thrive in postwar Vienna, Otto began seriously contemplating a career in the theater. In 1923, when Preminger was 17, his soon-to-be mentor, Max Reinhardt, the renowned Viennese-born director, announced plans to establish a theatrical company in Vienna. Reinhardt's\nroughly equivalent to that of the United States Attorney General. Markus was told that the position would be his only if he converted to Catholicism, which he refused to do. The next year, he relocated his family to Vienna, where Otto later claimed to have been born. Preminger's first theatrical ambition was to become an actor. In his early teens, he was able to recite from memory many of the great monologues from the international classic repertory, and, never shy, he demanded an audience.

The Bose crescograph uses a series of clockwork gears and a smoked glass plate to record the movement of the tip of a plant (or its roots) at magnifications of up to 10,000. Marks are made on the plate at intervals of a few seconds, demonstrating how the rate of growth varies under varying stimuli. Bose experimented with temperature, chemicals, gases, and electricity.

    "O_A": "To answer the question of which director has had a greater impact on French culture, Jean Vigo or Sri Lankabhimanya Lester James Peries, we need to examine the contributions and influence of both directors.\n\nJean Vigo was a French film director who made a significant impact on French cinema during the 1930s. His films, such as \"L'Atalante\" and \"Zero for Conduct,\" were known for their innovative storytelling techniques and social commentary. Vigo's films challenged traditional narrative structures and explored themes of rebellion and freedom. His work was highly influential and inspired future generations of filmmakers in France and beyond.\n\nOn the other hand, Sri Lankabhimanya Lester James Peries is considered the father of Sri Lankan cinema. He began his filmmaking career in 1949 and went on to direct over 28 films, including \"Rekava,\" \"Gamperaliya,\" and \"Nidhanaya.\" Peries revolutionized Sri Lankan cinema by giving it a unique identity and introducing outdoor shooting techniques. His films explored various social and cultural issues in Sri Lanka and received critical acclaim both domestically and internationally.\n\nWhile both directors have made significant contributions to their respective film industries, it can be argued that Jean Vigo had a greater impact on French culture. Vigo's innovative storytelling techniques and social commentary challenged the norms of French cinema and influenced future generations of filmmakers. His films continue to be studied and celebrated in France, and his legacy has had a lasting impact on French cinema.\n\nIn comparison, Lester James Peries' impact on Sri Lankan cinema is undeniable, as he is considered the father of the industry and has directed numerous acclaimed films. However, his influence on French culture may be more limited in comparison to Vigo's impact on French cinema.\n\nTherefore, based on the reasoning chain, it can be concluded that Jean Vigo has had a greater impact on French culture compared to Sri Lankabhimanya Lester James Peries.",

The technical manual and power transformer were sold separately, as were a kit of I.C. sockets, a BASIC interpreter program and from mid-1982 onwards, a metal case to house the computer. The computer proved to be a popular construction project, with an advertisement in November 1982 claiming: \"Over 2000 sold.\" The popularity of the Super-80 led to a small industry growing up around addressing the shortcomings of the original computer - especially the black and white, 32 \u00d7 16\ncharacter, upper case only video display. The original name of the computer was \"Nova-80\", but it was changed at the last minute to avoid \"possible legal ramifications\". The Super-80 was based on the Zilog Z80 8-bit microprocessor. As standard, it had 16 kB of dynamic RAM in the form of eight 4116 RAM chips. RAM could be expanded to 32 kB or 48 kB through the addition of rows of eight 4116 RAM chips. The computer was assembled on a single double-sided printed circuit board. The board was supplied in a light cardboard sleeve that appeared to be an LP\nrecord sleeve, having the words \"Dick Smith Super 80 Microcomputer Kit Printed Circuit Board\" and the part number \"Cat H-8402\" printed along the spine. To keep the price of the computer and the component count down, a novel technique was used to implement the video display. Instead of an expensive video display controller chip with dedicated memory, the Super-80 used discrete TTL logic to implement the video display and 512 bytes of system RAM was shared between the video display and the CPU. Fifty times per second, the CPU was turned off for around 10 ms by asserting the Z80",

It is published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). Jan S. Hesthaven is the current editor-in-chief, assuming the role in January 2016. The impact factor is currently around 2. This journal papers address computational issues relevant to solution of scientific or engineering problems and include computational results demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed techniques. They are classified into three categories: 1)\ndevelopment of computational methods and high-quality software, parallel algorithms, high-performance computing issues, new architectures, data analysis or visualization. However, the primary focus should be on computational methods that have huge impact on scientific or engineering problems. The modern numerical analysis can be dated back to 1947 when John von Neumann and Herman Goldstine wrote a pioneering paper, \u201cNumerical Inverting of Matrices of High Order\u201d (Bulletin of the AMS, Nov. 1947). This paper commonly is considered as one of the first papers to study rounding error and include discussion of what is called scientific computing nowadays. Although, from math history, numerical\nanalysis has a longer and richer history, \u201cmodern\u201d numerical analysis is defined by the mix of the programmable electronic computer, mathematical analysis, and the opportunity and need to solve large and complex problems in life applications. The need, such as, ballistics prediction, neutron transport, and nonsteady, multidimensional fluid dynamics pushed the development of computer and depended strongly on developments in numerical analysis and mathematical modeling.

At its heyday, the carrier operated international services to the United States and Uruguay, as well as an extensive domestic network within Argentina. Additionally, the company also operated charter services. Domestic and regional flights were operated from downtown's Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, whereas an international service to Atlanta was operated from Ministro Pistarini International Airport.

As a subsidiary of Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas, the company shares its headquarters with that airline, which is located in the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery of Buenos Aires, the main base of operations of the company.

In practice, operations of the latter airline were absorbed by CATASACI, which was rebranded as \"Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas S.A.\" after merging. Austral inherited both companies' fleet, consisting of turboprops NAMC YS-11 and jetliners BAC One-Eleven. Austral became a government-owned company in 1980. After poor economic performances, there were two failed attempts to re-privatise Austral in 1981 and 1983. All that time Austral and Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas were competitors on a number of domestic routes. Realizing that such a situation could not persist much longer, the\nthe company was 10% owned by its erstwhile competitor Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas. On 21 July 2008 the Argentine Government took the airline back into state control after acquiring 99.4% of the share capital for an undisclosed price. The remaining 0.6% continues to be owned by the company's employees.

It was the penultimate event for the UFC in 2011. The event featured eight bouts televised internationally, seven preliminary bouts aired on cable in the United States and Canada, and three preliminary bouts streamed live on Facebook. In the co-main event, Frank Mir, who was the first man to knock out Ant\u00f4nio Rodrigo Nogueira at UFC 92, became the first man to submit Nogueira. Mir accomplished the feat\nUFC 178. On August 12, 2014, it was announced that Jones had sustained a leg injury in training, causing him to withdraw from UFC 178 in his scheduled fight against Cormier. The bout was rescheduled, and eventually took place on January 3, 2015, at UFC 182. Jones won the fight by unanimous decision (49\u201346, 49\u201346, and 49\u201346), losing only one round to Cormier. He also became the first person to take Cormier down, scoring three takedowns in total. The win also earned Jones his fourth \"Fight of the Night\" bonus award. It was later revealed that Jones failed a drug\nwas in the works for a second time, and a bout was targeted for December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. However, a lingering thumb injury cost another title opportunity for Evans, and Jones instead faced Lyoto Machida at the same event. Despite getting rocked in the first round by Machida, Jones successfully defended the light heavyweight title at UFC 140, stopping Machida at 4:26 of the second round via technical submission (guillotine choke), which caused Machida to collapse unconscious along the cage. This was the first submission loss in Machida's career. Jones defeated his archrival and former teammate Rashad Evans",

Parker called it a triumph of Roman defensive strategy. Arther Ferril considers that, barring the Battle of Qarqar (Karkar), which was forgotten at his time, this was the first significant conflict that involved large alliances on both sides. No single nation dominated either side; rather, two alliances met and fought in surprising coordination for the time. Meghan McEvoy also believes that the successful construction and utilization of the federates in Gaul was a testament to Aetius' diplomatic and\ndismiss his Frankish allies, and collected the booty of the battlefield for himself. The primary sources give little information as to the outcome of the battle, barring Jordanes.

Hughes takes his own interpretation of this, noting that the divination may be an emphasis of Attila's barbarity and therefore possibly a fabrication. He states that the choice to begin the battle at the ninth hour was due to the fact both sides spent the whole day carefully deploying their coalition armies.
